# open-decision-framework
A community version of the Open Decision Framework

Context: 
For the past few years at Red Hat, we’ve been grappling with the challenges of growing an open organization and sustaining our culture along the way. One tool we’ve been developing and testing is the Open Decision Framework, a collection of best practices for applying open source principles [1] to business projects and decisions. 

The Open Decision Framework contains the collective wisdom of Red Hatters, compiled into a flexible framework that helps decision makers and leaders seek out diverse perspectives and collaborate across teams and geos, to make better decisions. 

The community version is available under a Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0 license [2]. The content reflects the internal version we use at Red Hat, minus a few links to content on our intranet or other internal websites. 

Take a look, and let us know what you think. Feel free to remix it, and share it with project managers, team leaders, and decision-makers in your organization!
